Overview
This project implements a basic lane detection system using Python and OpenCV. It processes a video stream frame by frame to detect lane lines on the road and highlights them in the output. The detection is based on computer vision techniques such as color filtering, Gaussian blurring, Canny edge detection, and the Hough Transform.
